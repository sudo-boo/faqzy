# Sarcathon-2024

## Gettings Started
This contains all of our solution's source code. The project is a mono repo, which means that all of the code is in one repository. This makes managing dependencies and sharing code between different project parts easier.

## See Demo
Explore the `./Demo` folder for a preview of the solution in action. We recommend watching the demo once to better understand the project's workflows and features.

## Client
The client application is written in **Flutter** 
It is chosen considering:
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop).
- Ease of deployment and streamlined development across multiple environments.

## Backend
This section contains the code for the API backend built with** Django REST Framework** and the **SQLite database**, ensuring a lightweight and efficient solution for handling data.

## Docker
**Dockerfile** to provide the setup to containerize each service. These ensure consistent and reproducible environments, simplifying the deployment process across platforms.

## Kubernetes
The k8s directory contains **Kubernetes** configuration files that are used to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.
